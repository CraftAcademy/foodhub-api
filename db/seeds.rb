  title: 'Polish Bigos',
  description: 'The national Polish dish Bigos is also Known as Hunter\'s Stew. There are so many recipes for bigos, it is hard to know what is best. Some bigos recipes add tomato paste, some do not. Some have mushrooms, others don\'t.
  
  One thing is certain: all bigos recipes will have naturally fermented cabbage with just water and sea salt (sauerkraut) and some form of meat--pork, beef, sausage, venison, bacon, or veal. 
  ',
  directions: '
  1.  CARAMELIZE ONIONS & MUSHROOMS WITH BACON.  Place chopped onions in large stock pot with chopped raw bacon on medium heat. COVER. Mix occasionally until the onions start to brown.  Add mushrooms and cook until soft. Do not make the bacon crispy.
  
  2.  ADD MEAT. Add sausage and all meat, mixing and browning.  If you need more fat, add olive oil. You do not want to over cook the meat, just brown on the outside.  If you use good smoked Polish sausage, you do not need to brown very long.
  
  4.  ADD REST OF INGREDIENTS. Put all ingredients together in your large pot, but not the prunes. If there is not enough room, add the cabbage first to reduce it a little. 
  
  5.  SAUTÉ FOR 2 TO 3 HOURS ON LOW.  Cook until you reduce the liquid and it becomes more of a thick stew. Mix every 20 minutes or so and make sure it is not dry. You can add more red wine or broth if needed. Bigos should always be juicy. Taste, but it will not have the flavor until the next day.  But, you can add more paprika or pepper. 
  
  6.  ADD PRUNES.  Mix thoroughly and heat with prunes for another 10 minutes--until soft.  Enjoy with Rye bread (if you can\'t wait), or store in fridge.  Really good with Potato Cheese pierogi too--and Cabbage, Mushroom, and Kraut.',

One of the secrets to a moist, delicious, and beautiful turkey is spreading butter under the skin. You can season the butter any way you want; the possibilities are endless.',
  ingredients: '
    2 tablespoons kosher salt
    1 tablespoon ground black pepper
    1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
    1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets reserved
    2 onions, coarsely chopped

    1 tablespoon butter
    1/4 cup all-purpose flour
    3 cups turkey pan drippings
    1/4 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (optional)
    1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage
    salt and ground black pepper to taste',
  directions: '
    1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

    2. Mix 2 tablespoons salt, and 1 tablespoon pepper, and poultry seasoning in a small bowl. Tuck turkey wings under the bird, and season cavity with about 1 tablespoon of the poultry seasoning mixture. Reserve remaining poultry seasoning mix.
    
    3. Toss the onion, celery, and carrots together in a bowl. Stuff about 1/2 cup of the vegetable mixture, rosemary sprigs, and 1/2 bunch sage into the cavity of the turkey. Tie legs together with kitchen string. Loosen the skin on top of the turkey breast using fingers or a small spatula. Place about 2 tablespoons butter under the skin and spread evenly. Spread the remaining butter (about 2 tablespoons) all over the outside of the skin. Sprinkle the outside of the turkey with the remaining poultry seasoning mix.
    
    4. Spread the remaining onion, celery, and carrots into a large roasting pan. Place the turkey on top of the vegetables. Fill the pan with about 1/2 inch of water. Arrange a sheet of aluminum foil over the breast of the turkey.
    
    5. Roast the turkey in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 3 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Remove the foil during the last hour of cooking. Baste the turkey with the pan juices.
    
    6. While the turkey is roasting, make stock: place neck, heart, and gizzards in a saucepan with the bay leaf and water. Simmer over medium heat for 2 hours. Strain the turkey giblets from the stock, and discard giblets. There should be at least 4 cups of stock. 
    
    7. Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Pour the pan juices, about 3 cups, into a saucepan and set aside. Skim off the turkey fat from the pan juices, reserving about 2 tablespoons.
    
    8. Heat 2 tablespoons of the turkey fat and 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Transfer the onion from the roasting pan into the skillet. Cook and stir until the onion is browned, about 5 minutes, then stir in the flour. Continue to cook and stir for about 5 minutes more; whisk in 4 cups of the skimmed turkey stock and the reserved pan juices until smooth; skim off any foam. Stir in the balsamic vinegar. Simmer until the gravy is thickened, whisking constantly, about 10 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of chopped sage, and season to taste with salt and black pepper.',

    1. The pasta is cooked in moderately salted boiling water.

A mixture of raw eggs (or yolks) grated Pecorino (or a mixture with Parmesan) and a good amount of ground black pepper is combined with the hot pasta either in the pasta pot or in a serving dish but away from direct heat to avoid curdling the egg. 

    3. The fried guanciale is then added and the mixture is tossed creating a rich creamy sauce with bits of meat spread throughout.

    5cm piece of ginger
    1 teaspoon cayenne pepper or red chilli flakes (for extra heat)
    1 teaspoon smoked paprika
    2 tablespoons groundnut or vegetable oil',
  directions: '
    1. Use a pestle and mortar to grind the peanuts, keeping them fairly coarse. Reserving a small handful to serve, place the nuts in a large bowl.

    2. Peel and grate in the garlic and ginger (keep the ginger skin on if organic), then stir in the remaining spice rub ingredients along with 1 pinch of sea salt and 1 teaspoon of coarse black pepper.

    3. Add the diced goat and massage the rub thoroughly into the meat. Peel and quarter the red onion, then deseed and cut the peppers into chunks.

    4. Thread the onion, peppers and goat onto your skewers. As ever, the longer you can leave your meat to marinate the better it will be, so if you have time, leave the skewers in the fridge for at least 1 to 2 hours, or preferably overnight.

    5. Take the skewers out of the fridge and sit at room temperature for a few minutes while you get the grill or griddle pan hot.

    6. Baste the meat with a little oil, sea salt and black pepper before putting it under the grill or on the griddle - it should sizzle but do not move it! Turn only every 2 minutes, until each side is seared through (for medium-rare) or every 3 minutes on each side for well done.

    7. Allow to rest for 2 minutes, then scatter over the reserved peanuts and a small pinch of chilli powder. Tear over the coriander leaves, then serve with a fresh seasonal salad. Boom! Summer spice in your mouth!',
